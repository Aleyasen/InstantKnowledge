Trivia
First film in the series not to feature either Sam Neill, Laura Dern or Jeff Goldblum. This was divisive decision by the director; "I know a lot of fans want to see the original characters back. They're iconic. But I respect those actors too much to shoehorn them into this story for my own sentimental reasons. Jurassic Park isn't about the bad luck of three people who keep getting thrown into the same situation. The only reason they'd go back to that island is if the screenwriters contrived a reason for them to go." See more »
